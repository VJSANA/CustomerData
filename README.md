This React and Node.js application, backed by PostgreSQL, manages a dataset of 50 dummy records. The backend, powered by Express, provides API endpoints for pagination, sorting (by date or time), and search functionality (by name or location). The React frontend, deployed as a single-page application, showcases the data in a paginated table with separate "date" and "time" columns derived from the "created_at" field. The user-friendly interface enhances data retrieval, creating an organized and efficient platform for displaying and interacting with the dataset.
**Backend (Node.js with Express and PostgreSQL)**
1. **Setup Node.js Project:**
   - Initialize a new Node.js project using `npm init`.
   - Install required packages: `express`, `pg` (PostgreSQL driver).
2. **Database Configuration:**
   - Create a PostgreSQL database and a table with the specified columns (`sno, customer name, age, phone, location, created_at`).
   - Connect your Node.js application to the PostgreSQL database using the `pg` package.
3. **Populate Database:**
   - Write a script to insert 50 dummy records into the database with random data for each column.
4. **Create API Endpoints:**
   - Implement API endpoints to retrieve data from the database, including pagination, sorting, and searching.

### Frontend (React)
1. **Setup React Project:**
   - Create a new React application using `npx create-react-app`.
2. **Create Components:**
   - Create components for the table, search bar, and pagination.
3. **Fetch Data from Backend:**
   - Use `fetch` or `axios` to make API calls to the backend and retrieve the data.
4. **Display Data in Table:**
   - Render the data in a table format on a single page.
5. **Implement Search Functionality:**
   - Create a search bar that allows users to search by "name" or "location". Update the displayed data accordingly.
6. **Implement Pagination:**
   - Paginate the data with 20 records per page.
7. **Display Created At in Separate Columns:**
   - Split the `created_at` column into "date" and "time" and display them in separate columns.
8. **Implement Sorting:**
   - Add a sorting option to sort the data either by "date" or by "time".

### Integration
1. **Connect Frontend to Backend:**
   - Ensure that the frontend can make API requests to the backend.
2. **Test the Application:**
   - Test the application to ensure that all functionalities work as expected.
3. **Styling and UI/UX:**
   - Apply CSS styles to improve the user interface and experience.

### Deployment

1. **Deploy Backend and Frontend:**
   - Deploy the Node.js backend (e.g., on Heroku, AWS, or any other cloud platform).
   - Deploy the React frontend separately.
2. **Database Hosting:**
   - Consider hosting your PostgreSQL database (e.g., on Heroku, AWS RDS).
   - 
### Additional Notes
- Ensure that proper error handling is implemented both on the frontend and backend.
- Consider using environment variables for sensitive information such as database credentials.
- Make the code modular and maintainable by organizing it into separate files and folders.

This outline will guide you through building a React and Node.js application with PostgreSQL as the database, incorporating the specified functionalities.
