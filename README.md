This React and Node.js application, backed by PostgreSQL, manages a dataset of 50 dummy records. The backend, powered by Express, provides API endpoints for pagination, sorting (by date or time), and search functionality (by name or location). The React frontend, deployed as a single-page application, showcases the data in a paginated table with separate "date" and "time" columns derived from the "created_at" field. The user-friendly interface enhances data retrieval, creating an organized and efficient platform for displaying and interacting with the dataset.
